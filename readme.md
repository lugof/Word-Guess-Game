## About the game:

* This game is about guessing a random Street fighter character name
* First you have to press any key to start
* You will have to guess the character name next to "Your character"
* Press the keyboard letter to guess
* You will have only 10 attemps and the game will re-start over again if you loose


## Objective
* Create a game where user has to guess a word, letter by letter. The word spaces should be shown to the user as underscores. 
    Each time a letter is guessed, the letter will reveal on screen.
* User should have a limited amount of attemps. If out of attemps, user loses.
* Maintain a section to keep user score for wins and loses and start over the game in case user loses. New random hidden word should appear.




## Technical approach
1. Create backbone html.
2. Add each word to an array in order to be used in for loops.
3. Create functions to show the underscores.
4. Create function to show letter that user has found.
5. If cases checking for every letter on the whole word to be guessed.
6. Functions in case of winning, loosing, randomly showing new words.
7. Show user score and maintain it.
